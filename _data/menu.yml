      hello, i'm efe. i've been creating games for over 10 years now.
      
      during that time, i've had the chance to work on a variety of projects,
      ranging from console to mobile, and mmo to single-player games.
      
      i'm using this page to catalog some of those projects. thank you for visiting!
