# DNAI

**DNAI** is a streamlined Utility AI framework optimized specifically for Tycoon games. Inspired by [@git-amend](https://github.com/git-amend)'s Utility AI concepts, DNAI provides a clear and efficient approach to enhance NPC behaviors and interactions in Tycoon-style gameplay. Notable features include comprehensive **Memory** and **Knowledge** systems, which add depth and realism to your game's AI.

## Features
